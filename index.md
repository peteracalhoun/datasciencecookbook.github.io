# Welcome to the Data Science Cookbook!

A resource to help data scientists go from **problem to prototype**

### What is this?
An open-source “cookbook” to enable bottom-up data science in DoD units at the edge of the formation. Help small teams get from 0 → 1. Check out the [about](/about) page for more details on the cookbook.
<br><br>


### How do I use this cookbook?
Like any cookbook, flip to the recipe you need. We tried to make each subsection stand on its own and be consumable on its own. If you don’t understand a particular ingredient in the recipe, use the ingredients section to learn more.
<br><br>

### Why did you make this?
Enablers of ML in DoD—infrastructure, funding, acquisition—are centralized.
Problems, problem solving, and prototyping—are decentralized. **We want to help merge top-down enablers with bottom-up problem solving**

### How does it work?
- _"Ingredients"_ → What goes in to the recipes (human capital, development environment, compute, data)
- _"Recipes"_ → Process. (defining the problem, data management, exploring data, building models, etc)
- Structure → bite-sized (<5 pg) articles
<br/><br/>

### Team
Data scientists, designers, and product managers with experience in DoD (AI Task Force, DIU, Kessel Run, Fort Meade, SOCOM, Harbinger and more)
<br/><br/>

### Audience
Operations Research Analysts, junior data analysts, data scientists, recent graduates of universities and grad school programs, bootcamp grads, product managers.
<br/><br/>

### Where do I go from here?
» **Take me to the [_about_](/about) section**<br/>
» **Show me the [_ingredients_](/ingredients)**<br/>
» **Take me to the [_recipes_](/recipes)**<br/>
» **Show me [_example code_](https://datasciencecookbook.github.io/appendix-b/) of machine learning in action**<br/>
